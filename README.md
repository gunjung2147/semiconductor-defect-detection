# semiconductor-defect-detection
This project aims to detect defects in semiconductor manufacturing using computer vision and image processing techniques.

Ah, I see! If you'd like to avoid the formatting symbols (like `#` and `*`), here's the plain text version without those markup elements:

**Project Outline and Scope**  
The goal is to develop a machine learning model (preferably using CNNs) that can detect defects on semiconductor wafers or chips based on images. This system would help automate the defect inspection process, reducing human error and increasing manufacturing efficiency.

**Project Steps**

**Step 1: Define the Problem**  
Objective: Detect defects (e.g., scratches, contamination, misalignments) in wafer or chip images.  
Classes: Decide whether you want to classify images into "defective" and "non-defective" categories or go deeper into types of defects (e.g., crack, particle contamination, etc.).

**Step 2: Gather Data**  
Dataset:  
- If you don't have access to industry-grade wafer images, look for public datasets like:
  - SEMI.org Wafer Inspection Dataset  
  - Kaggle datasets (search for "wafer defect detection").  
- You can also simulate simple defects on images or use synthetic data generation techniques if needed.
Preprocessing: Use image augmentation techniques to increase dataset variety (e.g., rotation, zooming, flipping) to simulate various conditions.

**Step 3: Choose Tools and Libraries**  
Programming Language: Python.  
Libraries:  
- OpenCV for basic image processing tasks like edge detection, filtering, etc.  
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training neural networks.  
- Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation.  
- Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization of results.

**Step 4: Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**  
- Convert wafer images into grayscale or use color channels if needed.  
- Normalize the image sizes to standard input dimensions (e.g., 256x256 pixels).  
- Apply augmentation techniques like random rotations, flips, and zooms to make the model more robust.

Example code for data augmentation:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'wafer_data/train',
    target_size=(256, 256),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary'
)
```

**Step 5: Build the Defect Detection Model (CNN)**  
CNN Architecture:  
- Start with a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with layers for feature extraction from wafer images.  
- If you're new to CNNs, use a pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet (transfer learning) and fine-tune it on your wafer images.

Example code for model creation:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Dropout

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(256, 256, 3))

model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification (defective or not)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

**Step 6: Train the Model**  
- Split your data into training and validation sets (e.g., 80/20 split).  
- Train the model using the training set and monitor its performance on the validation set.

Example code for training:

```python
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=100,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=50
)
```

**Step 7: Evaluate the Model**  
- After training, evaluate the model on a test set that it has not seen before. Check the accuracy and other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Plot the training and validation accuracy/loss curves.

Example code for plotting results:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='train accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='validation accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Step 8: Optimize and Fine-Tune**  
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust learning rates, batch sizes, and model depth to optimize performance.  
- Transfer Learning: If you started from scratch, try using pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet) with transfer learning to improve results.  
- Regularization: Apply techniques like Dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

**Step 9: Deployment**  
- Package the trained model into a user-friendly tool or prototype that can take wafer images and output defect classifications.  
- You can create a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter or deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for web-based use.

**Tools & Resources to Use**  
- Dataset: Kaggle, SEMI.org, or your own synthetic data.  
- Pre-trained Models: VGG16, ResNet, or custom CNN.  
- Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Matplotlib.  
- Hardware: If available, using a GPU will speed up training (can use Google Colab for free GPU access).

**Final Deliverables**  
- Trained Model: A CNN that can classify wafer images as defective or non-defective.  
- Results & Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.  
- Presentation: Document your process, including data preprocessing, model selection, results, and possible real-world applications.
