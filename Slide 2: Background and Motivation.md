To include a case study of Intel in terms of defect control in your presentation on "Defect Detection on Semiconductor Wafers Using Convolutional Neural Networks," you can highlight the following aspects:

### Background on Intel's Defect Control Challenges

Intel has historically faced challenges in defect control during semiconductor manufacturing. In its early years, Intel struggled with low yields due to production bugs, where only 1-5% of each run was successful. This was due to the complexity and precision required in the manufacturing process, where even a fleck of dust could cause a faulty device. The company had to perform meticulous reliability testing, conducting a million or more tests for each chip[2].

### Evolution and Improvements

Despite these challenges, Intel made significant advancements over time. The development of "shrink" technology for its microprocessors, such as the 386 chip, led to higher performance and increased yields. This technology involved reducing the geometry of chips, which allowed for more functionality and integration, ultimately improving defect control[2].

### Current Strategies and Technological Advancements

In recent years, Intel has continued to invest heavily in research and development to address defect control and improve manufacturing processes. The company is also focusing on data-centric computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to enhance its manufacturing capabilities[3]. These efforts are crucial as Intel faces stiff competition from other semiconductor giants like TSMC and Samsung[3].

By incorporating these points into your presentation, you can provide a comprehensive view of Intel's journey in defect control within semiconductor manufacturing.
